Growing up in Victoria, known as the stolen car state of Australia. Displaying expensive items along with leaving your car unlocked could mean you will most likely come back to nothing. After I had my 1989 Suzuki Vitara JLX stolen, it wasn‚Äôt the cost of the vehicle that I was devastated about but the amount of labour intensive hours that I had put into her, she would keep me warm in winter and cool in summer, she was the girlfriend I never had and I had named her Zuki. I eventually got her back after a month with not much damage apart from a few pulled fuses. They had taken my owner‚Äôs manual and service history, some loose change and a set of cheap earphones and a $1 eBay mp3 player. Hek even the items they left behind was probably worth more, I scored a set of NSW number plates, a pair of gardening gloves and a microfibre cloth.

Considering my owner‚Äôs manual and insurance details were gone, they had my address so I had to act quick before they come along to my house and take the car again. I didn‚Äôt want to spend a lot of money on a car alarm + immobiliser, so instead I decided to install a flashing blue led and a kill switch. 

Flashing LED Install:

I could have gone through the effort to buy a 555timer and build a flashing led circuit myself but after searching eBay I found a set of x20 12V Flashing Blue LED diodes for a measly $3 including 470ohm resistors. 

I tested the LED via a 12V Power Supply and LEDs were great with an average flash rate of 2 flashes per second. 

The installation process was very easy, trick is to find x2 12v power sources, one that is constantly on and another that is on only when the key is turned to accessories and off when the key is out of the ignition. This is sometimes known as the floating ground and essentially what happens is when the key is out of the ignition the polarity to the LED circuit will be positive (+) negative (-). When the key is turned to accessories it will than become positive (+) positive (+) which will therefore turn the LED off. 

I ended up splicing into a wire on my fuse box which I found was a constant 12V supply and spliced into my accessories wire to the head unit that contained the variable polarity. I was going to mount the LED at the front of the dashboard but found that I had a space next to my steering wheel beside my spotlight button where the led would mount easily. 

Kill Switch Install:

When wiring a kill switch, there are a few points that you could tap into; 

Fuel pump
Starter motor 
Battery 
Distributor 
Ignition Coil


My Zuki being a manual car, the starter motor and battery was out of the equation because you could easily jump start the car whilst rolling in gear. If the fuel pump was off, the car would still start and run until the lines would become empty therefore giving the theft about a block of drive time.

What I ended up doing was pulling a fuse called the ‚Äúignition coil-meter‚Äù and tested the ignition, the car would turn to accessories and turn over but would not start, which was perfect. 

I followed the wire, cut it and wired a 12v switch in series and put it‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.ah nice try. Sorry but really the position is up to you, I ended up re-using a switch in my car from factory, so if you do use a switch just don‚Äôt place it in the obvious.  

That‚Äôs all really and the result looked great, the LED was very bright and it actually made a great light when trying to insert the key into my ignition barrel on a late night and the kill switch was mounted in a position where I‚Äôll never forget to switch it off. So next time a theft comes around hopefully they‚Äôll be so impressed that they‚Äôll leave me a slab of beers üòâ
